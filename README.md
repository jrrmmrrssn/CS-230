The Gaming Room Design Template

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  In this scenario, I work for Creative Technology Solutions as a consultant. I am consulting for The Gaming Room, specifically the different approaches they may use to expand their game onto various operating systems. The Gaming Room has a game application called DRAW IT OR LOSE IT that was created for Android systems. They are trying to expand the app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. Before making a decision we are to evalutat the three main traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows) and mobile platforms for how the application could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so. evaluate the platforms based on characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I feel I did particularly well in describing the domain model and researching the characteristics, weaknesses, and advantages of each platform.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found each step of the process helpful in completing the next step of the process. Each step led into the next step and assisted in understanding the next step of the process better. Understanding the pattern and model helped better understand the flow of the program and code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  In my evaluation, I would focus more on evaluating the browsers on each platform rather than focusing on the platform alone due to the application being a web based application.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  Determining the users needs is important to providing a quality product that users will want to use. Users want a product that is fast and reliable and does not encounter bugs or issues when they are using the product. Weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms allows us to understand what each platform has to offer and weigh the options according to the applications needs such as a smooth operating flow, fast downloads, scalability without interuption etc.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  As we did here, it is important to understand the business and technical requirements of the client before beginning. Once the requirements are understood it is important to understand business and design constraints, develope a design model, evaluate the best platform based on requirements, and implement REST api's when developing applications.
